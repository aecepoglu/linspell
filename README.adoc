== The Algorithm

The algorithm relies on a hash-table mapping generating reduced(edited) words to their original versions.

.For example, the word "block"
-----
at distance 0: block
at distance 1: bloc blok blck bock lock
at distance 2: blc blk blo...
-----

Given any word to spell-check, we generate similarly reduced versions of it and search them in the hash-table.

.Given a word "blocq"
-----
at distance 0: blocq
at distance 1: bloc bloq blcq bocq locq
at distance 2: blc blq blo...

"bloc" maps to "block",
	"block" can be the correct spelling of the word "blocq"
