== The Algorithm

The algorithm relies on a hash-table mapping generating reduced(edited) words to their original versions.

.For example, the word "block"
-----
at distance 0: block
at distance 1: bloc blok blck bock lock
at distance 2: blc blk blo...
-----

Given any word to spell-check, we generate similarly reduced versions of it and search them in the hash-table.

.Given a word "blocq"
-----
at distance 0: blocq
at distance 1: bloc bloq blcq bocq locq
at distance 2: blc blq blo...

"bloc" maps to "block",
	"block" can be the correct spelling of the word "blocq"
-----

=== Performance

Looking up the spelling of a word _with length W_) takes:
- O(1), if it is correctly spelled
- O(W), if it is at 1\~2 edit distance
- O(2*W), if it is at 2\~4 edit distance

On an i7 3.4GHz machine, spell-checking a text with 250 words (https://www.usingenglish.com/files/pdf/spelling.pdf) takes 0.01 seconds
